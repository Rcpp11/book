This is a book about modern R and C++, serving both as 
a reference manual for [Rcpp11](https://github.com/Rcpp11/Rcpp11)
and a resource on R and C++ in general. 

Materials in this book assumes the C++11 standard, C++11 is what is meant 
by C++. No specific effort 
is made to systematically show how something could have been done 
with ancient C++. There are many other resources online for this. 

It is possible that some of the code presented in this book also works when 
compiled against [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) as both 
implementation share some history, but it is definitely not a goal.
