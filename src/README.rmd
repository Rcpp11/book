This is a book about modern R and C++, serving both as 
a reference manual for [Rcpp11](https://github.com/Rcpp11/Rcpp11)
and a resource on R and C++ in general. 

Materials in this book assumes the C++11 standard, and no specific effort 
is made to systematically show how something could have been done 
with ancient C++. There are many other resources online for this.
